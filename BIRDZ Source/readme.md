DESCRIPTION

The KryptoBirdz are an NFT space opera satire of 500 uniquely algorithmically generated Birdz from the cyberpunk cloud galaxy Mystopia. There are only one of each bird, and each one of them can be uniquely owned by one single person or secret entity on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was created as a joke by developer and audio engineer Clarian who released the first official NFT Synth Pop album, 'Whale Shark', on the Ethereum Blockchain ahead of Kings Of Leon - according to the blockchain and not according to Kings of Leon lol and FUD press. Selected press and appearances include The Old York Times, The Bolling Stones Magazine, PitchDork, FUD Liberal, FUD Conservative, and Guardian Shmardian. The KryptoBirdz are on the of the earliest examples of a â€˜Non-Nonsense-Non-Fungible-Token adhereing to the ERC-721 standard and all its interface solidity glory that powers the known and unknown cosmic metaverse coming to a future near you ;) 

ABSTRACT:
  Our Birdz comprise of pixelated anatomized components that are dynamically infalted and deflated and responsive to their counterparts with maximum derived limitations. These parts include: mouth, eyes, head and beak...
                  These heads are then presupposed to 'human' composed body. 

COMPOSITION:

Birdz Are A Hybrid built of generated skeletal faces superposed upon bodies.

All parts of the birdz are optional to generate except for the face component which is mandatory. For every attribute there is a matching img with index value starting at 0.
